# Smart Save

A fullstack web application built for College Students looking to save and invest their money. This application was built with MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. Built as a part of tamuhack 2023, our team created an AI model that would predict stock prices in the future using recurrent neural networks. This would work in tandem with our SmartSave score to provide insight on when to save and when to invest.
