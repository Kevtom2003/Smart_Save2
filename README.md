# Smart Save

A fullstack web application built for College Students looking to save and invest their money. This application was built with MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. Built as a part of tamuhack 2023, our team created an AI model that would predict stock prices in the future using a recurrent neural network. This would work in tandem with our SmartSave score to provide insight on when to save and when to invest.
